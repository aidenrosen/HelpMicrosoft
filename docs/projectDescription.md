# Project Description

[Home](./)

Our project is a GUI-based application that will automate the process of putting
an existing project on a computer up to GitHub.

As students who were involved in the previous QUreativity challenge, our hope is to further innovate GitHub,
and allow us to create a program that further simplifies an already amazing website.

In order to use our program, the following setup information can be found below, or via a link on our home page.

### [Setup](https://aidenrosen.github.io/HelpMicrosoft/setup)

The program uses Java to automate this process, along with the help of user input. The steps
are very user friendly as well as efficient toward the creation of a new repo.
